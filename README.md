# Solar Scanner Rock vs Mine

I built this because I was bored and I wanted to learn how to implement linear regression model. 

This problem of classification between rock & mine (binary classification) is "best" to be solved with linear regression model. 

**This video guided me through the steps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiz1ORTBGpY&list=PLfFghEzKVmjvuSA67LszN1dZ-Dd_pkus6**

I started with a basic framework on what to do: 
1. Put data into data frame
2. Seperate the data 
4. train and test data with model
5. Check accuracy
6. Test model with random data

Diffculty level: easy  
Recommend level (0-5): 5
